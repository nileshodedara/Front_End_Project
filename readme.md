#### 2. User testing
I asked one of my friends to go through the website to check it is useable and his feedback was positive and 
advised me to change some things such as adding some form of effect on the Skills section as he found it confusing.

#### 3. Intelligent application of Information Architecture and PARC
I have applied this in my navigation bar as it can be seen that it is very easy to use and is very simple.
In addition, I have added a sitemap in my footer and this is on all of the pages so that it is easy for the user to navigate.

#### 4.Resposive design
I have used @media queries to make my website responsive on different platform. In the beginning, I was using max-width for my media queries for the different screen but my tutor advised me to use min-width to make it more appropriate.   

```css
@media screen and (min-width: 500px)
```

```css
@media screen and (min-width: 900px)
```

#### 5. Learning & Understanding Markdown 

In my previous assignments I have used Markdown and am fairly good at using it as you can see from my readme.md file.


#### 6. API & JSON - Wikipedia
I have used the Wikipedia API in my skills section, which highlights all the different programming languages such as HTML and java.
in the skill section if a user clicks on any of the languages then Wikipedia will display the first sentence of the first result. also there is a search box which allows you to search any other skills. as you can see below

#### 7. HTML Validation
validation of the HTML and the CSS was very important through my website development process. Here are some examples of the errors that I faced during the process and I have also provided the evidence of fixed errors. I have used help from my tutors and lab notes to overcome these errors.

#### 9. Javascript Validation
There were few errors when I added the wiki api and amended it for my website it was showing me fail to load and fail to recognise errors. My tutors helped me fix these errors. at the moment there are no errors in my JavaScript.
