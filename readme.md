#### 2. User testing
I asked one of my friends to go through the website to check it it is usaable and his feedback was postive and 
advised me to change some things such as adding some form of effect on the Skills section as he found it confusing.

#### 3. Intelligent application of Information Architecture and PARC
i have applied this in my navigation bar as it can be seen that it is very easay to use and is very simple.
in addition i have added a sitemap in my footer and this is on all of the pages so that it is easy for the user to navigate.

#### 5. Learning & Understanding Markdown 

in my previous asssigmnets i have used Markdown and am fairley good at using it as you can see from my readme.md file.


#### 6. API & JSON - Wikipedia
i have used the wikipedia API in my skils section, which highlights all the diffrent programming languages such as HTML and java.
in the skill section if a user clicks on any of the langauges then wikipedia will dispaly the first sentence of the first result. also there is a search box which allows you to search any other skills. as you can see below

#### 7. HTML Validation

Throughout this development cycle, html & css validation was key. 
Below are some examples of HTML validation where errors were found and then resolved.

I have not supplied a CSS validation as you can see going through the styles.css that there are no syntax errors.
